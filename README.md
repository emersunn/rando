# Rando

This is a JavaScript script that generates a random hexadecimal color code and sets it as the background color of the body element of an HTML document. It also displays the generated color code in a HTML element with the ID "hex".

## Installation
There is no installation required for this script. You can simply copy and paste it into a .js file and include it in your HTML document with a script tag.

## Usage
To use this script, include it in your HTML document using a script tag. The script will automatically generate a random color and set it as the background color of the body element when the page loads. It will also display the generated color code in a HTML element with the ID "hex".

If you want to generate a new color, you can click a button with the ID "reload-button". This will call the setBackgroundColor() function and generate a new random color.

## Customization
You can customize this script by modifying the getRandomColor() function to generate colors in a different range or pattern. You can also modify the setBackgroundColor() function to set the background color of a different HTML element or to perform additional actions when the color is changed.
